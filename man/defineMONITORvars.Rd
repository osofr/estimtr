\usage{
defineMONITORvars(data, ID, t, imp.I, MONITOR.name = "N",
  tsinceNis1 = "last.Nt")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data.table or data.frame.}

\item{ID}{The name of the unique subject identifier (character, numeric or factor).}

\item{t}{The name of the time/period variable in \code{data}.}

\item{imp.I}{The name of the binary indicator of missingness or imputation for I at time point t and it is used for coding MONITOR(t-1):=1-imp.I(t).
When imp.I(t)=1 it means that the patient was not observed (no office visit) at time-point t and hence no biomarker was measured.}

\item{MONITOR.name}{The name of the MONITORing variable which will be evaluated by this routine.
This new column MONITOR(t) is the indicator of being monitored (having a doctors visit) at time-point t+1 the indicator of the
imputation (having observed/measured biomarker) at time-point t+1.}

\item{tsinceNis1}{The name of the future column (created by this routine) that counts number of periods since last monitoring event at t-1. More precisely,
it is a function of the past \code{bar{N}(t−1)}, where 0 means that N(t−1)=1; 1 means that N(t−2)=1 and N(t−1)=0; etc.}

\item{I}{The name of the numeric biomarker value which determines the dynamic treatment rule at each time point t.}
}
\value{
A data.table in long format with ordering (I, CENS, TRT, MONITOR)
}

\section{Details}{


Convert the input long format data with the time ordering: (I(t), imp.I(t), C(t), A(t))
into the data format required by the estmr() function: (I(t), C(t), A(t), N(t):=1-imp.I(t+1)).
N(t) at time-point t is defined as the indicator of being observed (having an office visit) at time point t+1 (next timepoint after t)
The very first value of I(t) (at the first time-cycle) is ALWAYS ASSUMED observed/measured (hence I.imp=0 for each first subject-time observation).
}

\section{The format of the input and output datasets}{


The input data.frame data needs to be in long format.

The format of the specified columns needs to be as follows.

The time ordering of the input data at each t is as follows: (I, imp.I, CENS, TRT)

The time ordering of the output data at each t is as follows: (I, CENS, TRT, MONITOR), where MONITOR(t)=1-imp.I(t+1).

In output data.table, MONITOR(t-1)=1 indicates that the biomarker I(t) at t is observed and vice versa.

In addition the output data.table will contain a column "tsinceNis1", where:
\itemize{
  \item tsinceNis1(t) = 0 means that the person was monitored at time-point t-1.
  \item tsinceNis1(t) > 0 is the count of the number of cycles since last monitoring event.
}
